  Hi, I am an engineer engaged in the development of autonomous driving control algorithms and mobile robot design.

  I am interested in areas such as autonomous driving decision-making, planning, and control; SLAM, DeepLearning; robot design and control, and how to use them to do more interesting and meaningful things.
